# Programming tracker

I wanted to make an app that deals with simple stats, data visualization, etc. I figured that a simple productivity/programming/etc tracker would be a good fit for this. I also eventually want to implement some sort of predictive algorithms to estimate how a user should stay on track. 

I'll make notes of the MVP and roadmap below in the future.

Backend is going to be written in Go(lang) and the frontend is using Next.js with Typescript (very original I know). Since it's in the early stages, I have considered using Vite too. We'll see. 

My reasoning for choosing Go for the backend is simply that I'm learning it and find the standard library cool (but I am willing to, and will likely have to, expand into other packages)

Goals are solid functionality for each feature, seamless UX, and an appealing UI.
